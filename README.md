Hello world ! I'm Statfone, here i'll publish some of the smart contracts i made. 
Feel free to use them in your projects if you want, i will try to keep my code as simple as possible to get the least security errors possible, but in case you notice one, please notify me so i can fix it.
I'm trying to keep my smart contracts as safe as i can, but i can't guarantee that they are 100% safe, so please remember you're the only one responsible in case of loss using these contract. Make sure to read the instructions before deploying a contract to make sure you're using it the right way !
